This is a flutter quick starter template project which support mobile (android, ios), web and desktop (MacOS, Linux, Windows) platform.

It also integrates with github actions for CI/CD. When you push a tag, then after a few minutes, all these platform build files are available in the [release](https://github.com/liudonghua123/flutter_app/releases) page.
